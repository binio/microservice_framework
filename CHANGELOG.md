### Changed
- Refactor all framework components that are not internal so that they are provided as interfaces
via new Framework API modules
- Rework interceptor chain so that it is specific to a service component, by allowing each component
to provide an interceptor chain definition rather than using annotation scanning

class will need to change the class name of their override to match**
- Improved logging for annotation scanning
- Add component to audit interceptor so that audit messages can distinguish between components even
when they are deployed in a single WAR.

### Removed
- Support for default sender destinations removed; senders now always require messaging clients to
be provided, typically by generating one from the destination RAML.
- Access control Provider annotation and annotation scanning; this functionality has moved to the access control library
- Precondition class marked as deprecated - will be removed in 3.0.0 unless a different use case is found for it

when they are deployed in a single WAR.

## [2.0.0-rc5] - 2017-06-20

### Changed
- Include base URI in class name for generated JMS listeners. This ensures they are unique, but any project that overrides the generated
class will need to change the class name of their override to match.

### Fixed
- Aggregate snapshot service was pulling in Liquibase due to an incorrect dependency scope

## [2.0.0-rc3] - 2017-06-16
